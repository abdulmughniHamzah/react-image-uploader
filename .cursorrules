# React Blob Uploader - Public Library Rules

## 🚫 Git Workflow
- ❌ Never run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` automatically
- ✅ Execute git commands only when the user explicitly requests them
- 🔄 Update this file and supporting docs whenever component APIs or structure change
- 📝 Sync any library modifications with the published `README.md` documentation immediately.

## 🧭 Working Expectations
- Maintain framework-agnostic patterns and flat mutation results
- Keep Tailwind-based styling overrides consistent

## 📚 Full Library Reference
