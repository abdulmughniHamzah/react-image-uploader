# React Blob Uploader - Public Library Rules

## Project Type
Framework-agnostic React component library (Published to GitHub)

## Git Workflow
- ❌ Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or other mutating git commands automatically.
- ✅ Run git commands only when the user explicitly requests them.
- 🔄 Keep this `.cursorrules` file (and documentation) updated whenever component APIs, library structure, or published features change.

## Key Principles
- Framework-agnostic design (works with ANY state management)
- Flat result structures (no nested data)
- 100% Tailwind CSS (no custom CSS variables)
- TypeScript with full type safety
- Comprehensive error handling with failed states

## Development
```bash
npm run build   # Build library
npm run dev     # Watch mode
```

## Publishing
- Committed dist/ folder for GitHub installs
- pnpm add github:abdulmughniHamzah/react-blob-uploader
